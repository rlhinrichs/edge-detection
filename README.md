## Edge Detection / Shadow & Highlight Detection

Dependencies:
- opencv-python (for cv2)
- scikit-learn (for sklearn)
- scikit-image (for skimage)
- numpy, matplotlib (basics)

Presenting a discussion of how Fourier Frequency Transform (FFT) from the <b>OpenCV</b> open-source library detects edges, highlights & shadows in Computer Vision at a mathematical level.

We explore Fourier Frequency Transformation (FFT), Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT), Low-Pass Filter Mask (LPF), and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) techniques.
